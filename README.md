# Advent of Code solutions

by me.

I used to have one repository per year, but recently decided to squash all of these together into one, bigger monorepo. I did not preserve the commits from the original repos while merging the old repos into this one. If you care about the original commits, please inspect the original repositories.

Thank you.
